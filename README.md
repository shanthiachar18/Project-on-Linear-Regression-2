# Prediction using Linear Regression
Building a prediction model for salary hiking
# Objective
Is to build a predictive model for salary hiking
# Overview
Used Necessory libries to perform EDA, Plotting and to get data information.Used Linear Regression model to predict the salary hike based on yearExperience.
# Methodology
# 1.Preproccesing and EDA:
Performed EDA to get more informative features like null values,outliers,correlation and so on. and got the below insights.
* No Null values in the dataset
* No outliers in the dataset
* There is good correlation between the two variables. The score is 0.98 which shows the strong positive correlation.
* variation is constant along the way in data
# 2.Model Building:
Used Simple Linear Regression model
# 3.Model Validation:
* R Square values
