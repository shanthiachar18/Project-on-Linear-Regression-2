# Prediction using Linear Regression
Building a prediction model for salary hiking
# Objective
Is to build a predictive model for salary hiking
# Overview
Used Necessory libries to perform EDA, Plotting and to get data information.Used Linear Regression model to predict the salary hike based on yearExperience.
# Methodology
# 1.Preproccesing and EDA:
Performed EDA to get more informative features like null values,outliers,correlation and so on. and got the below insights.
* No Null values in the dataset
* No outliers in the dataset
* There is good correlation between the two variables. The score is 0.98 which shows the strong positive correlation.
* variation is constant along the way in data
# 3.Feature Engineering
* Tried different transformation of data to estimate normal distribution and to remove any skewness
# 4.Fitting a Linear Regression Model
* Using 1. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
2. Square Root transformation on data
3. Cube Root transformation on Data
4. Log transformation on Data
# 5.Residual Analysis
1. Test for Normality of Residuals (Q-Q Plot)
2. Residual Plot to check Homoscedasticity or Hetroscedasticity
# 6.Model Validation
* Comparing different models with respect to their Root Mean Squared Errors.
# 7.Predicting values from Model with Log Transformation on the Data
